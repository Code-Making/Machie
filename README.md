Machine, A Flutter-based editor app.
</h1>

## Overview

Machine is first and foremost a code editor app. But, it offers an architecture to ease the process of building other editors.

Each editor is a plugin, that have access to the same building blocks (file opening/saving/caching, etc). It makes writing new pluginss easier, and less error-prone.

Machine uses a per-project type of file handling with explorer plugins to interact with the file system inside the project folder boundary (file hierarchy/search/git)

## Features
- SAF folder project managemdnt
